# To-Do List Web Application (Just Do It)

A simple, fast, and fully client-side task app. No backend, no build step—just open the files in a browser. Tasks are saved to `localStorage`.

## 1) How to run

### Open directly
1. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
2. Navigate via the sidebar to **Upcoming**, **Calendar**, and **Sticky Wall**.

> Tip: Chrome/Edge/Safari all work. If anything doesn’t render after edits, hard-refresh (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R).
